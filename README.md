#Hacking ED Planning - Team 5 - QGISNL

This is the repository where the team from The Netherlands QGIS User Group (qgis.nl) has collaborated
during the UNESCO Hacking event for Education Planning on 29 - 31 January 2021.

## Challenge

Our challenge was "School capacity planning based on population data, using the Sprague algorithm." and we decided to find a practical way of using the algorithm in QGIS.
